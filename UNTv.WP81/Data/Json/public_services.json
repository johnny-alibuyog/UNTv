                "description": "Trees support many life forms on Earth. This realization inspired UNTV to launch the<a href=\"http:\/\/addatree.untvweb.com\/\"><em> Add-A-Tree Project<\/em><\/a>, a global tree-planting drive that aims to restore a greener Earth starting from 50,000 fruit-bearing seedlings at its kick off on October 10, 2010 (10.10.10).\r\n\r\nThe project is part of UNTV\u2019s advocacy \u2013 <strong>Isang Araw Lang para sa Kalikasan<\/strong> (Just One Day for the Environment) \u2013 to make an impact via changing people\u2019s views and perspective about the environment. Named as such, the campaign sprang from the belief that every good cause one will make for the benefit of the Earth starts from one day.\r\n\r\nAs a humble commitment to the many environmental initiatives launched globally, the public service media channel\u2019s initiative shares the same breath with the United Nations Environmental Programme\u2019s pioneering campaign that targets to plant 12 billion trees.\r\n\r\nAs of December 2009, UNEP has recorded more than 7.4 billion trees planted under its The Plant for the Planet: Billion Tree Campaign. According to UNEP, this continuing campaign is expected to make a substantial contribution to the planet\u2019s biodiversity as it celebrates 2010 as the \u201cInternational Year of Biodiversity.\u201d\r\n\r\nTeaming up with the Philippines\u2019 Department of Natural Resources (DENR), the tree-planting activity will take effect for three years. Giving UNTV one hectare of land per region to conduct this project, DENR regional offices also identified target areas that will benefit from this campaign.\r\n\r\nUsing its news bureaus in regional areas in the Philippines, UNTV mobilized volunteers to this project with more than 50,000 seedlings planted at different DENR-mandated areas. After the planting session, volunteers will aid in the continuous nurturing of the seedlings until the trees are ready to live on their own.",

                "description": "<div>\r\n\r\nMedia coverage of emergencies and natural disasters is often criticized for sensationalized reporting and exaggerating the danger of violence in society. This is what UNTV tries not to follow with the launch of Tulong Muna Bago Balita initiative.\r\n\r\nIn crises situations like when lives of people in emergency situations are at stake, helping is secondary only to reporting. In turn, the role of rescue and emergency responder is relegated to the police or other emergency response groups because reporters as witnesses are expected to obtain exclusive access to a scoop, the journalistic parlance to breaking the news first.\r\n\r\nThe race to report first is standard fare as the competition to become the No. 1 news source is a target of almost all media firms. When news is exclusive, any broadcast company who broke the news first will surely win audience.\r\n\r\nAt <a href=\"http:\/\/www.untvweb.com\/\">UNTV<\/a>, correspondents are not pressured to make it their priority to break or report news exclusives so long as they put people's safety and welfare first. In fact, the public service station is very much concerned with saving the lives of people in emergency cases, as contemplated by UNTV's news advocacy, <em>Tulong Muna Bago Balita<\/em> (Assist Before Reporting).\r\n\r\nUNTV CEO <a href=\"http:\/\/www.danielrazon.com\/\">Daniel Razon<\/a>, who broached the advocacy several years ago but only launched the cause in 2010 when he had the chance, even encourages the training of the station's correspondents to equip them with rescue and safety skills for emergency missions.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur fellowmen are more important than anything else, more than getting and delivering news,\u201d Razon was quoted saying during UNTV\u2019s 6th anniversary celebration last July 18, 2010.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the news-and-rescue team is concentrated in the National Capital Region and nearby provinces. In order to carry out its rescue and emergency missions, UNTV launched 15 new, news and rescue mobile units last November 28, 2010. The rescue mobile units are equipped with facilities needed for rescue and first aid operations.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Razon announced that the rescue mission training will be initiated in all UNTV's local bureaus in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. Last December 31, 2010, UNTV formally launched its first News and Rescue Command Center at the station's building in Edsa, Quezon City, a unit similar to America's Rescue 911 to assist in responding during emergency and rescue cases.\r\n\r\nThe Tulong Muna Bago Balita is considered a milestone in Philippine broadcasting history launched last July 2010, when UNTV introduced the first batch of correspondents who graduated from the training with the Search and Rescue Unit Foundation (SARUF), a recognized army rescue unit in the Philippines.\r\n\r\n<\/div>",

Other sectors complain that if you are poor and you don't have money to use to pursue a case, you can just remain silent if you are the victim; or when accused, you must be prepared to rot in jail for a crime you did not commit.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of pursuing a case if you are penniless, as experienced by the poor and the indigents, remains one of the social cancers that afflict the justice system in the country. Inevitably, as the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, inequalities escalate.\r\n\r\nWith his experience in the media, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.danielrazon.com\/\">Daniel Razon<\/a> became a living witness to the malady.

UNTV CEO <a href=\"http:\/\/www.danielrazon.com\/\">Daniel Razon<\/a> conceptualized the public service endeavor even before he and the Education Department Secretary Armin Luistro discussed the alternative learning system project of DepEd.\r\n\r\nUnder the memorandum of agreement signed, UNTV and Ang Dating Daan had committed to donate two state-of-the art buses and facilities worth P14-million. The Education Department, on the other hand, provided the volunteer teachers.\r\n\r\nThe Dunong-Gulong mobile classroom project is a landmark in Philippine learning and education initiative primarily on the thrust of the alternative learning system (ALS) of providing not only basic but functional literacy and knowledge application.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the mobile classroom is geared to equip students with the necessary literacy lessons before they are fully integrated into institutions that offer formal education.\r\n\r\nFor its part, the Department of Education guarantees a curriculum-guided alternative learning approach. Unlike other regular schools-on-the-go, the ALS is not confined to watching DVDs of educational TV programs alone.\r\n\r\nVolunteer teachers from DepEd will facilitate the use of the mobile classrooms' facilities that include plasma TV, projector, books, instructional CDs, and other instructional media.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Energy, was tapped to provide alternative source of power. The mobile school will enjoy almost uninterrupted power supply as the agency promised to install 12 solar panels on each bus and provide standby generator when they reach areas with no electricity.\r\n\r\nEducation Sec. Armin Luistro has already expressed satisfaction over the project, admitting that this bold step is \"one hard act to follow,\" adding that, \u201cIt was only UNTV led by Kuya Daniel Razon who has solidified a promise into a long-term commitment.\"\r\n\r\nDunong Gulong piloted in Masbate and Quezon provinces.",
