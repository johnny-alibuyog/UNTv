REUTERS\/REUTERS TV<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Malian special forces stormed a luxury hotel in Bamako on Friday after Islamist gunmen took 170 people including many foreigners hostage in the capital of the former French colony, which has been battling rebels allied to al Qaeda for several years.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve penetrated inside the hotel. The operations are under way,&#8221; a police source told Reuters.<\/p>\n<p>State television said 80 hostages had been freed but the French newspaper Le Monde quoted the Malian security ministry as saying at least three people had been killed in the initial attack. A witness outside the hotel said gunfire could be heard from time to time.<\/p>\n<p>A senior security source said the gunmen had burst into Radisson Blu hotel at 7 a.m. (0200 ET), firing and shouting &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221;, or &#8220;God is great&#8221; in Arabic, and begun working their way through the building, room by room and floor by floor.<\/p>\n<p>Some hostages escaped under their own steam while others were freed after showing they could recite verses from the Koran, one security source said.<\/p>\n<p>Twelve Air France (AIRF.PA) flight crew were in the hotel, but all were extracted safely, the French national carrier said.<\/p>\n<p>A Turkish official said three of six Turkish Airlines staff who had been in the hotel had managed to flee.<\/p>\n<p>The Chinese state news agency Xinhua said several Chinese tourists were among those trapped inside the building.<\/p>\n<p>Malian President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita cut short a trip to a regional summit in Chad to return to Bamako, his office said. French President Francois Hollande said France would &#8220;use all the means available to us on the ground to free the hostages&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>The raid on the hotel, which lies just west of the city center near government ministries and diplomatic offices, comes a week after Islamic State militants killed 129 people in Paris.<\/p>\n<p>The identity of the Bamako gunmen, or the group to which they belong, is not known.<\/p>\n<p>ISLAMISTS ACTIVE IN MALI<\/p>\n<p>Northern Mali was occupied by Islamist fighters, some with links to al Qaeda, for most of 2012. They were driven out by a French-led military operation, but sporadic violence has continued in Mali&#8217;s central belt on the southern reaches of the Sahara, and in Bamako.<\/p>\n<p>One security source said as many as 10 gunmen had stormed the building, although the company that runs the hotel, Rezidor Group, said it understood that there were only two attackers.<\/p>\n<p>The hotel&#8217;s head of security, Seydou Dembele, said two private security guards had been shot in the legs in the early stages of the assault.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We saw two of the attackers. One was wearing a balaclava. The other was black-skinned. They forced the first barrier,&#8221; Dembele told Reuters.<\/p>\n<p>Within minutes of the assault, police and then soldiers had surrounded the hotel and were blocking roads leading into the neighborhood.<\/p>\n<p>It is not the first time Bamako has come under attack.<\/p>\n<p>An Islamist group claimed responsibility for the death of five people last March in an attack on a restaurant in Bamako that is popular with foreigners.<\/p>\n<p>And in August, 17 people were killed during an attack on a hotel in Sevare in central Mali, some 600 km (375 miles) northeast of Bamako, that was claimed by the Sahara-based Islamist militant group al-Mourabitoun.<\/p>\n<p>The dead in Sevare included nine civilians, five of whom worked for the U.N. mission in Mali (MINUSMA), as well as four Malian soldiers and four militants.<\/p>\n<p>In the wake of last week&#8217;s Paris attacks, an Islamic State militant in Syria told Reuters the organization viewed France&#8217;s military intervention in Mali as another reason to attack France and French interests.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is just the beginning. We also haven&#8217;t forgotten what happened in Mali,&#8221; said the non-Syrian fighter, who was contacted online by Reuters.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The bitterness from Mali, the arrogance of the French, will not be forgotten at all.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>France said it was dispatching 50 elite counter-terrorism officers to Bamako imminently.<\/p>\n<p>(Reporting by Tiemoko Diallo; Writing by Joe Bavier and Ed Cropley; Editing by Kevin Liffey)<\/p>\n",

Manila had also sought Lockheed Martin submarine-hunting P3-C patrol planes.<\/p>\n<p>Rather than challenge Beijing directly by sending warships or planes to patrol the South China Sea, Japan is helping to build the military capacity of friendly nations with claims to parts of the waterway.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;These negotiations take some time,&#8221; a senior Japanese official told Reuters, saying it could take one or two years before the two sides sign a deal on defense equipment and technology.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Japan wants an assurance that any equipment it will give will not be transferred to a third country.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>To allow the donation, Japanese lawmakers will either have to tweak curbs on sales of government-owned equipment, or set up a separate financing mechanism.<\/p>\n<p>Japan is also building 10 40-metre (131-ft) -long vessels for the Philippine coastguard. Manila needs 100-metre (328-ft) -long patrol ships.<\/p>\n<p>Japan changed defense policy this year in a shift that could let troops fight overseas for the first time since 1945. The move was welcomed by ally the United States, but fed concern in China, where memories of Japan&#8217;s wartime aggression run deep.<\/p>\n<p>(Reporting by Manuel Mogato; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)<\/p>\n",

REUTERS\/Social Media Website via Reuters TV<br \/><\/p><\/div>\n<p>The suspected mastermind of last week&#8217;s Paris attacks was killed in the police raid of an apartment north of the capital, French officials said on Thursday.<\/p>\n<p>Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a 28-year-old Belgian militant who had boasted of mounting attacks in Europe for the Islamic State, was accused of orchestrating last Friday&#8217;s coordinated bombings and shootings in the French capital, which killed 129 people.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It was his body we discovered in the building, riddled with bullets,&#8221; a statement from the Paris prosecutor said, a day after the pre-dawn raid. The prosecutor later added that it was unclear whether Abaaoud had detonated a suicide belt.<\/p>\n<p>Prime Minister Manuel Valls broke the news in Parliament to applause from lawmakers who were voting on Thursday to extend the country&#8217;s state of emergency for another three months.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We know today &#8230; that the mastermind of the attacks &#8211; or one of them, let&#8217;s remain cautious &#8211; was among those dead,&#8221; Valls told reporters. Confirmation that Abaaoud was in Paris will focus more attention on European security services, who ahead of Friday&#8217;s attacks had thought he was still in Syria.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is a major failing,&#8221; said Roland Jaquard at the International Observatory for Terrorism.<\/p>\n<p>Early on Wednesday morning, investigations led police to the house where Abaaoud was holed up in the Paris suburb of St. Denis. Heavily armed officers stormed the building before dawn, triggering a massive firefight and multiple explosions.<\/p>\n<p>Officials had said on Wednesday that two people were killed in the raid, including a female suicide bomber who blew herself up. Forensic scientists were trying to determine whether a third person had died. Eight people were arrested.<\/p>\n<p>Two police sources and a source close to the investigation told Reuters the St. Denis cell had been planning a fresh attack on Paris&#8217;s La Defense business district. A source close to the investigation said the female bomber who was killed might have been Abaaoud&#8217;s cousin.<\/p>\n<p>Investigators believe the attacks &#8211; the deadliest in France since World War Two &#8211; were set in motion in Syria, with Islamist cells in neighboring Belgium organizing the mayhem.<\/p>\n<p>The victims came from 17 different countries, many of them young people out enjoying themselves at bars, restaurants, a concert hall and a soccer stadium near where Wednesday&#8217;s police raid took place.<\/p>\n<p>Islamic State, which controls swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq, has claimed responsibility, saying the attacks were in retaliation for French air raids against their positions over the past year.<\/p>\n<p>France has called for a global coalition to defeat the extremists and has launched air strikes on Raqqa, the de-facto Islamic State capital in northern Syria, since the weekend. Russia has also targeted the city in retribution for the downing of a Russian airliner last month that killed 224.<\/p>\n<p>The Russian air force on Wednesday carried out a &#8220;mass strike&#8221; on Islamic State positions around Syria, including Raqqa, Russian news agencies reported.<\/p>\n<p>INTERNATIONAL COORDINATION<\/p>\n<p>Paris and Moscow are not coordinating their air strikes in Syria, but French President Francois Hollande is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Nov. 26 to discuss how their countries&#8217; militaries might work together.<\/p>\n<p>Two days before that, Hollande will meet in Washington with U.S. President Barack Obama to discuss the role of a U.S.-led coalition in any unified effort against Islamic State.<\/p>\n<p>France is one of several European countries participating in the U.S.-led coalition&#8217;s strikes against Islamic State targets in Iraq, and two months ago became the only European country to join strikes in Syria as well.<\/p>\n<p>Obama on Thursday reiterated the U.S. position that eradicating the group was tied up with ending the civil war in Syria, which could not happen as long as President Bashar al-Assad was in power.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Bottom line is, I do not foresee a situation in which we can end the civil war in Syria while Assad remains in power,&#8221; he told reporters in Manila on the sidelines of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit.<\/p>\n<p>(Reporting and writing by Crispian Balmer, Andrew Callus and Ingrid Melander; Editing by John Irish and Peter Graff)<\/p>\n",

Some were quickly shut down, while other relocated channels remained running.<\/p>\n<p>Alex Kassirer, a counter-terrorism analyst with the New York-based private intelligence firm Flashpoint, said IS had begun using Telegram channels in recent months to broadcast press releases aimed at recruiting and inspiring followers. <\/p>\n<p>Some of the dozens of channels set up drew as many as 16,000 followers, said Rita Katz, director of Bethesda, Maryland-based extremist monitoring service SITE Intelligence Group. Some of those channels can no longer be reached, and a message was displayed saying they were no longer available.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike Twitter, which has closed thousands of accounts tied to Islamic State for violating company rules, until Wednesday Telegram had appeared to let the jihadists operate without fear of being turned off or traced, Katz said.<\/p>\n<p>Telegram, which did not respond to requests for comment, explicitly says on its site that it makes efforts to block Islamic State.<\/p>\n<p>FIGHTING A DIFFERENT FIGHT<\/p>\n<p>The company statement stressed that shutting IS channels on the site was not taken to restrict free speech, which its ultra-secure messaging site is designed to encourage.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;While we do block terrorist bots and channels, we will not block anybody who peacefully expresses alternative opinions,&#8221; Telegram said.<\/p>\n<p>But IS supporters continue to take advantage of private members-only channels on Telegram to spread word of the new public propaganda channels.<\/p>\n<p>One newly set-up channel in English called Trendit, has nearly 500 followers so far, while other jihadi channels aimed at Islamic State supporters in Indonesia remained up, analysts said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The problem with blocking Telegram groups, like suspending Twitter or Facebook accounts, is that it becomes a game for IS supporters to see how fast they can get up another account,&#8221; said researcher Sidney Jones, who runs think-tank in Jakarta called the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict.<\/p>\n<p>It is often as simple as changing a letter or adding a number, then &#8220;shouting out&#8221; the new name to other followers online, she said.<\/p>\n<p>Telegram was set up by the two brothers who founded VKontakte.<\/p>\n<p>Pavel Durov, 31, the frontman, and his brother Nicolay, 34, the technical talent, were inspired by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden&#8217;s battle against widespread Internet surveillance and their own run-ins with Russian authorities.<\/p>\n<p>(Additional reporting by Douglas Busvine in New Delhi, Jim Finkle in Boston and Joseph Menn in San Francisco.; Editing by Jonathan Weber, Martin Howell and Ryan Woo)<\/p>\n",

Aquino III<br \/>President of the Philippines<br \/>during the press conference at the International Media Center<br \/>[Delivered at the World Trade Center, Pasay City, on November 19, 2015]<\/p><\/div>\n<p>It has been 19 years since the Philippines last hosted APEC. Back then, we led the setting of concrete steps to open up our economies in line with the Bogor Goals. This year, I am proud to have continued our success as hosts by laying the foundations on which APEC can chart a course to improve trade and strengthen quality growth. I thank my fellow APEC Leaders for their collaborative efforts and positive spirit as we worked together towards the goals that we share, and our cooperation gives us optimism that we can achieve greater progress sooner rather than later.<\/p>\n<p>These past couple of days, we discussed the critical regional and global issues we face as one Asia-Pacific region. If past APEC meetings were highly technical discussions on trade issues, the discussions over the past couple of days have taken a broader approach. We have sought to address the challenges presented by the ever-changing global economic milieu. For instance, we shared ideas on how to encourage technological innovation, while at the same time easing its disruptive effects on the job market by giving rise to more resilient economies. We have likewise been able to exchange ideas on how to foster greater inclusivity in our economies. Since inclusive growth has always been the guiding principle of our administration, we are proud to have put this approach front and center throughout our hosting APEC this year.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout the year, representatives from all member economies held 229 meetings to advance our individual economies and the region at large. During this time, we have seen our locales lend their names to strategies that will help empower small and medium enterprises, among others. There is, for instance, the Boracay Action Agenda, which will help micro, small, and medium enterprises access the global and regional markets. Complementing this is the Cebu Action Plan, which will widen entrepreneurial access to financial markets. Among its other benefits will be lowering the cost of remittances.  <\/p>\n<p>Apart from this, our representatives also finalized the Renewed APEC Agenda for Structural Reform, which will guide economies on which areas they need to reform to achieve sustained growth; as well as the Disaster Risk Reduction Framework, which recognizes the impact of climate change on our region. This framework aims to minimize losses and promote best practices so that we can build back better.<\/p>\n<p>At today\u2019s APEC Economic Leaders\u2019 Meeting, we agreed on the overarching frameworks under which we will pursue these plans. First, we adopted the APEC Strategy for Strengthening Quality Growth. This is a framework that will guide us in undertaking robust, comprehensive, and ambitious structural reforms over the next five years. We will focus our reform efforts, and measure our progress, in terms of institution building, social cohesion, and environmental impact. We do this with the awareness that the world economy continues to confront significant risk and uncertainty, even as trade growth is slowing down, thus impressing upon all of us, the need to tap into new opportunities for economic growth. This strategy will help APEC promote increased growth through structural reform.<\/p>\n<p>Second, the Leaders approved the APEC Services Cooperation Framework. The services sector is becoming a more important part of the economic equation. It makes up approximately two-thirds of the GDP in the APEC region, and we need to put more emphasis and thought into making this sector even more competitive. This Framework will lead to a goal-driven roadmap for us to achieve over the next decade, to help the sector thrive.<\/p>\n<p>To make the most of this gathering, the Philippines, for its part, took the opportunity to meet with leaders of economies, as well as leaders in the private sector, who had gathered here in Manila. We have taken existing partnerships to a new level. With Mexico, for instance, we committed to work together to combat drug trafficking, which is a common concern of our peoples. With Papua New Guinea, we offered our assistance in supporting their agriculture sector. It was also during this week that we formalized our strategic partnership with Vietnam and our comprehensive partnership with Australia. Moving forward, the areas in which we will work more closely together include defense, disaster risk reduction, and food security. We also engaged in dialogue with the Pacific Alliance, which is timely, given their high growth potential and ours.<\/p>\n<p>A number of leaders also expressed their support for the Philippines joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership, once it comes into force. This is a very encouraging sign; we of course want to join the TPP because it offers access to a far larger market. The USA and Australia, among other economies, expressed their support for this particular endeavor. Apart from that, we were also pleased to hear the news that the USA would be turning over to the Philippines a research vessel and a coast guard cutter which will boost the capabilities of our Navy.  <\/p>\n<p>Over the past week, we welcomed more than 11,000 people to our country, including those from the APEC Business Advisory Council, which, by the way, traces its origins to the APEC Summit in Subic in 1996 in the Philippines. This number is more than double the attendance of our previous hosting. In fact, when we said yes to hosting, it was with the expectation that all the facilities in construction at the time\u2014both public and private\u2014would be finished by the time we had to welcome our guests.  Apart from the fact that, as a general rule, each one of these visitors creates one new job for us; they have also now seen our country and met our people. In other words, they have discovered that the Philippines not only works, but it is indeed more fun.<\/p>\n<p>Our theme for APEC 2015 has been \u201cBuilding Inclusive Economies, Building a Better World.\u201d By balancing the discussions in APEC between the technical aspects of trade, and its implications on the social and environmental challenges of growth, we have refocused our discussions towards all our people\u2014the ones whose lives we, as leaders, are pledged to improve.<\/p>\n<p>For all these successes, I thank all those who worked tirelessly to make this event possible. Most importantly, I am grateful to our countrymen who have expressed their support for our hosting.  All my fellow leaders heaped praise on how our people have welcomed them, and their words really made me swell up with pride. Truly, it is a singular honor to lead such a great people. I am certain that, with your continued support, there is absolutely no doubt that the Philippines will continue its progress for years, if not generations to come.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you. Good evening.<\/p>\n<p>____<\/p>\n",

REUTERS\/Mohamed Abd El Ghany<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Russia revived on Wednesday a push for United Nations approval of international military campaigns combating Islamic State, setting up a showdown with France over its rival bid for a U.N. Security Council resolution on the issue.<\/p>\n<p>Russia circulated to the 15-member council an updated version of a draft resolution it first proposed on Sept. 30, diplomats said. Veto power Britain had dismissed the initial Russian draft and few negotiations were held on that text.<\/p>\n<p>Russian U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin told the council the text had been updated to focus more on combating Islamic State in reaction to recent attacks by the militant group, according to diplomats at the closed-door meeting, who spoke on condition of anonymity.<\/p>\n<p>Diplomats said there had been no major changes and that Russia had scheduled negotiations for Thursday.<\/p>\n<p>Russia revived its draft after France said it would push for a resolution on terrorism following the deadly attacks in Paris on Friday for which the militant group has claimed credit. French U.N. Ambassador Francois Delattre said it would be &#8220;short, strong and focused on the fight against our common enemy.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In this respect we consider the Russian proposal is a contribution that we will carefully study,&#8221; Delattre told reporters, signaling that France was not prepared to team up with Russia on a joint resolution.<\/p>\n<p>He said the French draft would have one clear goal &#8220;to make sure that the international community is united in the fight against Daesh (Islamic State).&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Diplomats said the updated Russian draft still called on states involved in military efforts against the Islamic State group and other militants to coordinate with the countries where they were operating. In the case of Syria, this would mean coordinating military activities with President Bashar al-Assad&#8217;s government.<\/p>\n<p>A U.S.-led coalition informed Syria when it began air strikes more than a year ago but did not seek permission. The coalition members have said they are acting in collective self-defense at the request of neighboring Iraq.<\/p>\n<p>Russia began air strikes in September after it said Syria had requested its military assistance.<\/p>\n<p>In October, a Russian passenger plane crashed in Egypt&#8217;s Sinai Peninsula, killing all 224 people on board. Russia and Western governments have said the plane was likely brought down by a bomb and on Wednesday Islamic State&#8217;s official magazine carried a photo of a Schweppes drink it said was used to make an improvised bomb that brought down the plane.<\/p>\n<p>The Islamic State group has also claimed responsibility for coordinated attacks in Paris last Friday in which 129 people were killed.<\/p>\n<p>(Reporting by Michelle Nichols; Additional reporting by Louis Charbonneau; Editing by Toni Reinhold)<\/p>\n",

It has always said its main target is Islamic State militants, but most of its bombs in the past hit territory held by other groups opposed to its ally Assad.<\/p>\n<p>Islamic State claimed responsibility for last week&#8217;s killing spree by bombers and gunmen in Paris and for the bombing of a Russian airliner over Egypt last month.<\/p>\n<p>Obama added that if he could get all the parties talking on the issue, &#8220;that could create space for that pivot&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. president also said he could close the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba while keeping Americans safe, but acknowledged he would face tough resistance from Congress.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I will guarantee you there will be strong resistance because in the aftermath of Paris, I think there is a very strong tendency for us to get worked up around issues that don&#8217;t actually make us safe but make for good political soundbites, whether it is refugees or Guantanamo,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>(Reporting by Matt Spetalnick; Writing by John Chalmers; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)<\/p>\n",

(BABA.N), which is looking to make inroads into foreign markets, including the United States.<\/p>\n<p>During the discussion on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Manila, the U.S. president probed Ma on how he thought government and established businesses could help young entrepreneurs.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Government is simple &#8211; just reduce the tax, or no tax, for these guys,&#8221; Ma responded, to a wave of laughter and applause from the audience of business executives.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You got a lot of cheers from your fellow CEOs,&#8221; Obama quipped in response.<\/p>\n<p>Ma&#8217;s remarks come as Alibaba works to invest heavily in ventures abroad. Executives have said its push beyond the China market is a top priority, as the company works to maintain its rapid growth even as the prospect of e-commerce saturation at home looms large.<\/p>\n<p>Alibaba has said some of its larger overseas markets include Brazil and Russia.<\/p>\n<p>Obama also praised the relatively unknown Filipina entrepreneur, Aisa Mijeno, a professor of engineering who invented a lamp powered by salt water. He suggested that Ma should invest in the company of his fellow panelist after she said she was looking for funding to mass-produce the lamps.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I\u2019m just saying,&#8221; Obama said, throwing Ma a suggestive look. &#8220;Serving as a matchmaker here, a little bit.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>Ma smiled in response. He said Alibaba had been putting 0.3 percent of the company&#8217;s total revenue for the past six years toward encouraging young people to find solutions to climate change and other environmental issues.<\/p>\n<p>Ma added that he thought it was a &#8220;fantastic idea&#8221; to invest in clean technology, referring to a recent conversation in which Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) co-founder Bill Gates broached the idea.<\/p>\n<p>Agreement on climate change is one of the bright spots in Washington&#8217;s troubled relationship with Beijing, which has been shaken recently by a row over China&#8217;s increasingly assertive posture in the South China Sea.<\/p>\n<p>Leaders of the two countries agreed in September to a common vision for a global climate change agreement, including steps to deliver on earlier pledges to slash greenhouse gas emissions.<\/p>\n<p>(Additional reporting by Karen Lema; Editing by John Chalmers and Raju Gopalakrishnan)<\/p>\n",

REUTERS\/Christian Hartmann<br \/><\/p><\/div>\n<p>A woman suicide bomber blew herself up and another militant died on Wednesday when police raided an apartment in the Paris suburb of St. Denis seeking suspects in last week&#8217;s attacks in the French capital.<\/p>\n<p>Officials said police had been hunting Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgian Islamist militant accused of masterminding the Nov. 13 carnage, but more than seven hours after the launch of the pre-dawn raid it was still unclear if they had found him.<\/p>\n<p>Seven people were arrested in the operation, which started with a barrage of gunfire, including three people who were pulled from the apartment, officials said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It is impossible to tell you who was arrested. We are in the process of verifying that. Everything will be done to determine who is who,&#8221; Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said at the end of the operation.<\/p>\n<p>Molins said the assault was ordered after phone taps and surveillance operations led police to believe that Abaaoud might have been in St. Denis, near to the soccer stadium which was site of one of the attacks that hit Paris last week.<\/p>\n<p>A total of 129 people died in the coordinated bombings and shootings. Investigators believe the worst atrocity in France since World War Two was set in motion from Syria, with Islamist cells in neighboring Belgium organizing the mayhem.<\/p>\n<p>Two police sources say investigators believe the St. Denis group had been planning an attack on the French capital&#8217;s La Defense business capital.<\/p>\n<p>Local residents spoke of their fear and panic as the shooting started in St. Denis just before 4.30 a.m. (2330 Tuesday ET).<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We could see bullets flying and laser beams out of the window. There were explosions. You could feel the whole building shake,&#8221; said Sabrine, a downstairs neighbor from the apartment that was raided.<\/p>\n<p>She told Europe 1 radio that she heard the people above her talking to each other, running around and reloading their guns.<\/p>\n<p>Another local, Sanoko Abdulai, said that as the operation gathered pace, a young woman detonated an explosion.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;She had a bomb, that&#8217;s for sure. The police didn&#8217;t kill her, she blew herself up&#8230;,&#8221; he told Reuters, without giving details.<\/p>\n<p>Three police officers and a passerby were injured in the assault. A police dog was killed.<\/p>\n<p>FLEEING RAQQA<\/p>\n<p>Islamic State, which controls swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq, has claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks, saying they were in retaliation for French air raids against their positions over the past year.<\/p>\n<p>France has called for a global coalition to defeat the radicals and has launched three large air strikes on Raqqa &#8212; the de-facto Islamic State capital in northern Syria.<\/p>\n<p>Russia has also targeted the city in retribution for the downing of a Russian airliner last month that killed 224 people.<\/p>\n<p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said on Wednesday the bombardments have killed at least 33 Islamic State militants over the past three days.<\/p>\n<p>Citing activists, the Observatory said Islamic State members and dozens of families of senior members had started fleeing Raqqa to relocate to Mosul in neighboring Iraq.<\/p>\n<p>French prosecutors have identified five of the seven dead assailants from Friday &#8211; four Frenchmen and a man who was fingerprinted in Greece last month after arriving in the country via Turkey with a boatload of refugees fleeing the Syria war.<\/p>\n<p>Police believe two men directly involved in the assault subsequently escaped, including Salah Abdeslam, 26, a Belgian-based Frenchman who is believed to have played a central role in both planning and executing the deadly mission.<\/p>\n<p>Until Wednesday morning, officials had said Abaaoud was in Syria. He grew up in Brussels, but media said he moved to Syria in 2014 to fight with Islamic State. Since then he has traveled back to Europe at least once and was involved in a series of planned attacks in Belgium foiled by the police last January.<\/p>\n<p>A man in St. Denis told reporters that he had rented out the besieged apartment to two people last week.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Someone asked me a favor, I did them a favor. Someone asked me to put two people up for three days and I did them a favor, it&#8217;s normal. I don&#8217;t know where they came from I don&#8217;t know anything,&#8221; the man told Reuters Television.<\/p>\n<p>He was later arrested by police.<\/p>\n<p>FALSE ALERT<\/p>\n<p>Late on Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said two Paris-bound Air France flights were diverted following anonymous bomb threats, and hundreds of passengers and crew were safely removed.<\/p>\n<p>Authorities in the United States and Canada, where the planes landed, later said both aircraft had been searched and were safe.<\/p>\n<p>Paris and Moscow are not coordinating their air strikes, but French President Francois Hollande is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Nov. 26 to discuss how their countries&#8217; militaries might work together.<\/p>\n<p>Hollande is due to meet U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington two days before that to push for a concerted drive against Islamic State, which controls large parts of Syria and Iraq.<\/p>\n<p>Obama said in Manila on Wednesday he wanted Moscow to shift its focus from propping up Syria&#8217;s government to fighting Islamic State and would discuss that with Putin.<\/p>\n<p>Russia is allied to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The West says he must go if there is to be a political solution to Syria&#8217;s prolonged civil war.<\/p>\n<p>(Additional reporting by Andrew Callus, Matthias Blamont, Marine Pennetier, Emmanuel Jarry, Marie-Louise Gumuchian, Jean-Baptiste Vey, Chine Labb\u00e9, Svebor Kranjc, John Irish in Paris, Alastair Macdonald and Robert-Jan Bartunek in Brussels, and Matt Spetalnick in Manila, Victoria Cavaliere and Dan Whitcomb in Los Angeles, Amran Abocar in Toronto and Dan Wallis in Denver; Writing by Alex Richardson and Crispian Balmer; Editing by Andrew Callus and Sonya Hepinstall)<\/p>\n",

The Salt Lake Tribune, citing an airport official, said it was carrying 497 passengers and crew.<\/p>\n<p>The FBI said in a statement that no evidence was found aboard the plane &#8220;which would lend credibility to the threats&#8221; against the flight.<\/p>\n<p>The airport said operations were not affected, and local Utah media including broadcaster KSL reported that passengers had been cleared to reboard and resume their journey.<\/p>\n<p>Keith Rosso, a passenger who tweeted a photo shortly after takeoff from Los Angeles, said he was &#8220;thankful to everyone who has been working to keep everyone calm and make sure air travel is safe. Hope to be taking off again shortly.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>A separate Boeing 777 that left Dulles International Airport outside Washington, D.C., Flight 55, was diverted to Halifax International Airport in Nova Scotia, which said 262 passengers and crew members had safely disembarked.<\/p>\n<p>The Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Halifax said on its Twitter feed that police dogs searched the plane for evidence of explosives, but no details were disclosed.<\/p>\n<p>In a brief statement, Air France said both flights had been the &#8220;subjects of anonymous threats received after their respective take-offs.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;As a precautionary measure and to conduct all necessary security checks, Air France, applying the safety regulations in force, decided to request the landings of both aircraft,&#8221; the airline said in its statement.<\/p>\n<p>It said authorities inspected the aircraft, passengers and luggage, adding: \u201cAn investigation will be led by the authorities to identify the source of the telephone call.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Security officials have been on high alert since Islamic State militants claimed responsibility for attacks last week in Paris that killed 129 people. Russia has said the group was also responsible for the downing on Oct. 31 of a plane returning to St. Petersburg from the Sharm al-Sheikh resort in Egypt, killing all 224 on board.<\/p>\n<p>The incidents did not appear to be causing flight delays or cancellations elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>According to data on flight tracking website flightradar24.com, flights operated by both Air France and other airlines appear to be taking off and landing normally at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris.<\/p>\n<p>(Reporting by Victoria Cavaliere, Dan Whitcomb and Steve Gorman in Los Angeles, Amran Abocar in Toronto and Daniel Wallis in Denver; Editing by Ken Wills)<\/p>\n",

Mandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports<\/p><\/div>\n<p>(The Sports Xchange) &#8211; Stephen Curry scored seven of his game-high 37 points in the final 88 seconds to help a sloppy Golden State Warriors overcome 20 turnovers and remain unbeaten with a 115-110 win over the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We can play better than this,&#8221; Curry told reporters after the league&#8217;s sole remaining undefeated team improved to 12-0 on the season and tied a franchise record for consecutive regular-season wins with 16 dating back to the last campaign.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We hold ourselves to a high standard. Everybody likes to learn lessons and win,&#8221; he added of a hard-fought victory that was also Golden State&#8217;s 25th straight at home during the regular season.<\/p>\n<p>The Warriors, who trailed 98-96 with 5:54 to play, had moved 106-103 ahead before Curry buried a 15-footer to create a five-point cushion with 1:28 to go.<\/p>\n<p>Golden State did the rest of its scoring at the foul line, with Curry making five of six and power forward Draymond Green two in a row to keep Toronto at arm&#8217;s length down the stretch.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve gotten away from playing four solid quarters of basketball,&#8221; Warriors interim coach Luke Walton said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We played a great first half tonight. But in the third quarter, I just felt like we let them get into a rhythm and build some confidence.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The loss was the Raptors&#8217; second straight to open a five-game road trip.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our guys played well enough to win,&#8221; Toronto coach Dwane Casey said. &#8220;We have something good going. We play like that in any game, we&#8217;re going to give ourselves a chance to win.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In a game stalled to a snail&#8217;s pace by 54 foul calls and 66 free throws, Casey thought one call and one non-call down the stretch doomed his team.<\/p>\n<p>The non-call occurred on a driving basket by Toronto shooting guard DeMar DeRozan with 38.7 seconds remaining. The hoop brought the Raptors within 109-108 but Casey was hoping for an extra free throw opportunity that might have tied the score.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of contact in there,&#8221; the coach said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to look at it again.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Then, after blocking a Curry layup attempt on Golden State&#8217;s next possession, Raptors point guard Kyle Lowry was called for an offensive foul when he got entangled with power forward Draymond Green while setting a screen with 15.4 seconds left.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if it was a screen or it was two guys getting tangled up,&#8221; Casey said. &#8220;Again, I&#8217;ve got to look at it to see.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Four subsequent free throws by the Warriors iced the win.<\/p>\n<p>(Editing by John O&#8217;Brien)<\/p>\n",

REUTERS\/Jonathan Ernst<\/p><\/div>\n<p>U.S. President Barack Obama put tensions over Beijing&#8217;s claims to the South China Sea squarely on the agenda ahead of an Asia-Pacific summit on Tuesday, pointedly visiting the main warship of close ally the Philippines shortly after he landed in Manila.<\/p>\n<p>While Obama affirmed a commitment to the Philippines&#8217; security and to freedom of navigation in regional waters, a senior official in Beijing said China was the real victim of the waterway dispute because other countries had illegally occupied islands there.<\/p>\n<p>The verbal jousting could cast a shadow over the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit of about 20 heads of state and government, including Chinese President Xi Jinping. Manila has said it will not bring up the maritime dispute to avoid embarrassing Xi, but could not prevent others from doing so.<\/p>\n<p>Xi also arrived in Manila on Tuesday, but did not make any public comments.<\/p>\n<p>Shortly after Air Force One touched down in Manila, Obama boarded the Gregorio del Pilar, a Philippines navy frigate that was a U.S. Coast Guard cutter until 2011 but on Tuesday flew the flags of the two allies.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We have a treaty obligation, an iron-clad commitment to the defense of our ally the Philippines,&#8221; he said, flanked by about two dozen U.S. and Philippines uniformed navy personnel. &#8220;My visit here underscored our shared commitment to the security of the waters of this region and to freedom of navigation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>He did not mention China but the symbolism of his visit was hard to miss: the ageing vessel is now a mainstay of the Philippine Navy, operating around the Spratly islands in the South China Sea that are claimed by both Manila and Beijing.<\/p>\n<p>Obama also announced two more U.S. ships would be transferred to the Philippines as part of a two-year $250 million package to enhance regional maritime security &#8211; a research vessel to help navigate territorial waters and a coast guard cutter for &#8220;long endurance patrols&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>He brought the dispute up again at a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, telling reporters it was important to uphold the &#8220;basic principle that these issues should be resolved by international norms and rule of law, and peacefully settled&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Hours earlier, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin said China was the real victim in the South China Sea dispute as &#8220;dozens&#8221; of its islands and reefs had been illegally occupied by three of the claimants. He did not name any countries.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The Chinese government has the right and the ability to recover the islands and reefs illegally occupied,&#8221; Liu told reporters in Beijing. &#8220;But we haven&#8217;t done this. We have maintained great restraint with the aim to preserve peace and stability.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Beijing has overlapping claims with Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei in the South China Sea, through which $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes every year.<\/p>\n<p>Last week, U.S. B-52 bombers flew near Chinese artificial islands in the area, signaling Washington&#8217;s determination to challenge Beijing over the disputed sea.<\/p>\n<p>ISLAMIC STATE THREAT<\/p>\n<p>The APEC meeting is the first of two regional summits that were supposed to bolster trade and security ties but have been clouded by last week&#8217;s coordinated attacks on Paris by the Islamic State.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this week, the G20 summit in Turkey was also dominated by discussions about the violence emanating from Syria\u2019s 4-1\/2-year-old civil war.<\/p>\n<p>From Manila, many of the leaders go on to Kuala Lumpur to attend an East Asia summit at the weekend.<\/p>\n<p>For Obama, the latest flurry of summitry illustrates how his effort to &#8220;rebalance&#8221; U.S. policy toward Asia-Pacific countries has consistently run into the geopolitical reality that the persistently volatile Middle East cannot be ignored.<\/p>\n<p>The Philippines was on high alert as the leaders arrived for the APEC meeting.<\/p>\n<p>Police in Manila, a city of 12 million, closed off many roads leading to the venues of the meeting, causing heavy traffic jams. Local media said the gridlock was so bad that a woman in labor didn&#8217;t make it to hospital and gave birth in her car.<\/p>\n<p>Philippines officials say there has been no intelligence suggesting there might be an attack on the Manila summit but about 30,000 police and soldiers have been deployed to guard it.<\/p>\n<p>In a draft of the APEC leaders&#8217; final statement seen by Reuters, the leaders condemned terrorism and said they were resolved to counter it together.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Under the shadow cast by the recent attacks in Paris, we stand in solidarity with the people of France and all victims of terrorism elsewhere,&#8221; the statement draft said.<\/p>\n<p>Obama said he and Australia&#8217;s Turnbull also discussed ramping up pressure on Islamic State.<\/p>\n<p>He is likely to discuss the friction over the South China Sea and military relations when he meets Philippine President Benigno Aquino on the sidelines of the summit on Wednesday.<\/p>\n<p>Aquino and Japan&#8217;s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe are also expected to agree on a deal paving the way for Tokyo to supply Manila with used military equipment, possibly including aircraft that could be deployed to patrol the South China Sea, sources said.<\/p>\n<p>Separately, Manila and Hanoi signed a strategic partnership deal on Tuesday to agree on how their navies will work together.<\/p>\n<p>(Additional reporting by Karen Lema, Megha Rajagopalan and Manuel Mogato in MANILA, Michael Martina in BEIJING; Writing by John Chalmers; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)<\/p>\n",

TONGO\/POOL<\/p><\/div>\n<p>China has shown &#8220;great restraint&#8221; in the South China Sea by not seizing islands occupied by other countries even though it could have, a senior Chinese diplomat said on Tuesday ahead of two regional summits where the disputed waterway is likely to be a hot topic.<\/p>\n<p>Beijing has overlapping claims with Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei in the South China Sea, through which $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes every year.<\/p>\n<p>Reclamation work and the building of three airfields and other facilities on some of China&#8217;s artificial islands in the Spratly archipelago have alarmed the region and raised concern in Washington that China is extending its military reach deep into maritime Southeast Asia.<\/p>\n<p>But China was the real victim as it had &#8220;dozens&#8221; of its islands and reefs in the Spratlys illegally occupied by three of the claimants, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin told a news conference in Beijing.<\/p>\n<p>He did not name the countries, but all claimants except Brunei have military fortifications in the Spratlys.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The Chinese government has the right and the ability to recover the islands and reefs illegally occupied by neighboring countries,&#8221; Liu said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;But we haven&#8217;t done this. We have maintained great restraint with the aim to preserve peace and stability in the South China Sea.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Tensions over the South China Sea are likely to dominate the East Asia Summit in Kuala Lumpur later this week.<\/p>\n<p>While not on the formal agenda of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit on Wednesday and Thursday in Manila, the South China Sea is expected to be discussed on the sidelines.<\/p>\n<p>U.S. President Barack Obama, who arrived in Manila on Tuesday, will attend both meetings. Chinese President Xi Jinping is in Manila for APEC while Premier Li Keqiang will represent China in Malaysia.<\/p>\n<p>Liu said China did not want the South China Sea to be the focus of the East Asia Summit. But he noted it would be hard to avoid and that some countries would raise it.<\/p>\n<p>LONG AIRSTRIPS BENEFICIAL<\/p>\n<p>China&#8217;s island building in the Spratlys was not about militarization, Liu said, adding for example that too much attention had been placed on the length of China&#8217;s airstrips.<\/p>\n<p>Satellite photographs show construction is finished on a 3,000-metre-long (10,000-foot) airstrip on Fiery Cross Reef. Security experts say such an airfield would be able to accommodate most Chinese military aircraft.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Actually, the larger they are, the more civilian benefits they will bring,&#8221; Liu said, pointing to the disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 last year as evidence of the poor state of search and rescue capabilities in the South China Sea. Rescuers initially focused their search on the waterway before moving to the Indian Ocean.<\/p>\n<p>Liu also repeated Beijing&#8217;s standard line that while China&#8217;s building work was for defense, its main focus was civilian.
