Hence, DEAR KUYA offers both information and entertainment \u2013 a substitute to the usual formats of programs being aired on the same time slots which are nothing but political bickering and exposes of anomalies.\r\n\r\nCatering to all sectors of society, DEAR KUYA features profound discussions on interesting topics and issues that directly affect the people\u2019s lives (like family relations, health, science and technology, and other relevant social problems). The discussion of each topic culminates with the words of wisdom and pieces of advice which will be given by the program\u2019s resource person, Bro. Eli Soriano. As he always does, Bro. Eli\u2019s advice is based on the teachings of the Holy Scriptures.\r\n\r\nSoothing and inspiring music, which are relative to the topic\/issue being discussed, are also played from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe program, likewise, aims to establish a healthy interaction with its listeners that is why it encourages them to send text messages and\/or post their comments and reactions about the program in the different social networking sites. But since the program also wants to be of help to its listeners who are beleaguered by some problems, and they need some enlightenment and spiritual advice, they are encouraged to write about it and send it to the program\u2019s host. The would-be chosen letter will receive a prize of P10,000.\r\n\r\nThe last hour of DEAR KUYA (11am to 12:00nn) is devoted to the chosen letter-sender whose story will be dramatized live by UNTV-Radio La Verdad\u2019s voice talents, with Kuya Daniel as the narrator. At the end, Bro. Eli will, once again, give insights and pieces of advice which are all Bible-based.\r\n\r\nYou may send your questions, greetings, stories, and signal feedbacks thru:\r\n\r\nTWITTER: @DearKuya\r\nEMAIL: dearkuya@untvradio.com\r\nADDRESS: 907 EDSA, Brgy.
