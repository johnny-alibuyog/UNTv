Hence, DEAR KUYA offers both information and entertainment \u2013 a substitute to the usual formats of programs being aired on the same time slots which are nothing but political bickering and exposes of anomalies.\r\n\r\nCatering to all sectors of society, DEAR KUYA features profound discussions on interesting topics and issues that directly affect the people\u2019s lives (like family relations, health, science and technology, and other relevant social problems). The discussion of each topic culminates with the words of wisdom and pieces of advice which will be given by the program\u2019s resource person, Bro. Eli Soriano. As he always does, Bro. Eli\u2019s advice is based on the teachings of the Holy Scriptures.\r\n\r\nSoothing and inspiring music, which are relative to the topic\/issue being discussed, are also played from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe program, likewise, aims to establish a healthy interaction with its listeners that is why it encourages them to send text messages and\/or post their comments and reactions about the program in the different social networking sites. But since the program also wants to be of help to its listeners who are beleaguered by some problems, and they need some enlightenment and spiritual advice, they are encouraged to write about it and send it to the program\u2019s host. The would-be chosen letter will receive a prize of P10,000.\r\n\r\nThe last hour of DEAR KUYA (11am to 12:00nn) is devoted to the chosen letter-sender whose story will be dramatized live by UNTV-Radio La Verdad\u2019s voice talents, with Kuya Daniel as the narrator. At the end, Bro. Eli will, once again, give insights and pieces of advice which are all Bible-based.\r\n\r\nYou may send your questions, greetings, stories, and signal feedbacks thru:\r\n\r\nTWITTER: @DearKuya\r\nEMAIL: dearkuya@untvradio.com\r\nADDRESS: 907 EDSA, Brgy.

Hence, DEAR KUYA offers both information and entertainment \u2013 a substitute to the usual formats of programs being aired on the same time slots which are nothing but political bickering and exposes of anomalies.\r\n\r\nCatering to all sectors of society, DEAR KUYA features profound discussions on interesting topics and issues that directly affect the people\u2019s lives (like family relations, health, science and technology, and other relevant social problems). The discussion of each topic culminates with the words of wisdom and pieces of advice which will be given by the program\u2019s resource person, Bro. Eli Soriano. As he always does, Bro. Eli\u2019s advice is based on the teachings of the Holy Scriptures.\r\n\r\nSoothing and inspiring music, which are relative to the topic\/issue being discussed, are also played from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe program, likewise, aims to establish a healthy interaction with its listeners that is why it encourages them to send text messages and\/or post their comments and reactions about the program in the different social networking sites. But since the program also wants to be of help to its listeners who are beleaguered by some problems, and they need some enlightenment and spiritual advice, they are encouraged to write about it and send it to the program\u2019s host. The would-be chosen letter will receive a prize of P10,000.\r\n\r\nThe last hour of DEAR KUYA (11am to 12:00nn) is devoted to the chosen letter-sender whose story will be dramatized live by UNTV-Radio La Verdad\u2019s voice talents, with Kuya Daniel as the narrator. At the end, Bro. Eli will, once again, give insights and pieces of advice which are all Bible-based.\r\n\r\nYou may send your questions, greetings, stories, and signal feedbacks thru:\r\n\r\nTWITTER: @DearKuya\r\nEMAIL: dearkuya@untvradio.com\r\nADDRESS: 907 EDSA, Brgy.

Hence, DEAR KUYA offers both information and entertainment \u2013 a substitute to the usual formats of programs being aired on the same time slots which are nothing but political bickering and exposes of anomalies.\r\n\r\nCatering to all sectors of society, DEAR KUYA features profound discussions on interesting topics and issues that directly affect the people\u2019s lives (like family relations, health, science and technology, and other relevant social problems). The discussion of each topic culminates with the words of wisdom and pieces of advice which will be given by the program\u2019s resource person, Bro. Eli Soriano. As he always does, Bro. Eli\u2019s advice is based on the teachings of the Holy Scriptures.\r\n\r\nSoothing and inspiring music, which are relative to the topic\/issue being discussed, are also played from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe program, likewise, aims to establish a healthy interaction with its listeners that is why it encourages them to send text messages and\/or post their comments and reactions about the program in the different social networking sites. But since the program also wants to be of help to its listeners who are beleaguered by some problems, and they need some enlightenment and spiritual advice, they are encouraged to write about it and send it to the program\u2019s host. The would-be chosen letter will receive a prize of P10,000.\r\n\r\nThe last hour of DEAR KUYA (11am to 12:00nn) is devoted to the chosen letter-sender whose story will be dramatized live by UNTV-Radio La Verdad\u2019s voice talents, with Kuya Daniel as the narrator. At the end, Bro. Eli will, once again, give insights and pieces of advice which are all Bible-based.\r\n\r\nYou may send your questions, greetings, stories, and signal feedbacks thru:\r\n\r\nTWITTER: @DearKuya\r\nEMAIL: dearkuya@untvradio.com\r\nADDRESS: 907 EDSA, Brgy.

The advocacy reinvents the old way of thinking and practice of media coverage that is only confined to exclusive-hungry reporting to be called competitive, even to the point of sacrificing the welfare of people in need of help.\r\n\r\nTo beef up the operation of this new and bolder news approach, Daniel Razon launched early in 2011 a news-and-rescue command center, an office UNTV dedicates to receiving and responding to calls for emergency.",

The discussion of each topic culminates with the words of wisdom and pieces of advice which will be given by the program\u2019s resource person, Bro. Eli Soriano. As he always does, Bro.

But since the program also wants to be of help to its listeners who are beleaguered by some problems, and they need some enlightenment and spiritual advice, they are encouraged to write about it and send it to the program\u2019s host. The would-be chosen letter will receive a prize of P10,000.\r\n\r\nThe last hour of DEAR KUYA (11am to 12:00nn) is devoted to the chosen letter-sender whose story will be dramatized live by UNTV-Radio La Verdad\u2019s voice talents, with Kuya Daniel as the narrator.

Hence, DEAR KUYA offers both information and entertainment \u2013 a substitute to the usual formats of programs being aired on the same time slots which are nothing but political bickering and exposes of anomalies.\r\n\r\nCatering to all sectors of society, DEAR KUYA features profound discussions on interesting topics and issues that directly affect the people\u2019s lives (like family relations, health, science and technology, and other relevant social problems). The discussion of each topic culminates with the words of wisdom and pieces of advice which will be given by the program\u2019s resource person, Bro. Eli Soriano. As he always does, Bro. Eli\u2019s advice is based on the teachings of the Holy Scriptures.\r\n\r\nSoothing and inspiring music, which are relative to the topic\/issue being discussed, are also played from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe program, likewise, aims to establish a healthy interaction with its listeners that is why it encourages them to send text messages and\/or post their comments and reactions about the program in the different social networking sites. But since the program also wants to be of help to its listeners who are beleaguered by some problems, and they need some enlightenment and spiritual advice, they are encouraged to write about it and send it to the program\u2019s host. The would-be chosen letter will receive a prize of P10,000.\r\n\r\nThe last hour of DEAR KUYA (11am to 12:00nn) is devoted to the chosen letter-sender whose story will be dramatized live by UNTV-Radio La Verdad\u2019s voice talents, with Kuya Daniel as the narrator. At the end, Bro.

Hence, DEAR KUYA offers both information and entertainment \u2013 a substitute to the usual formats of programs being aired on the same time slots which are nothing but political bickering and exposes of anomalies.\r\n\r\nCatering to all sectors of society, DEAR KUYA features profound discussions on interesting topics and issues that directly affect the people\u2019s lives (like family relations, health, science and technology, and other relevant social problems). The discussion of each topic culminates with the words of wisdom and pieces of advice which will be given by the program\u2019s resource person, Bro. Eli Soriano. As he always does, Bro. Eli\u2019s advice is based on the teachings of the Holy Scriptures.\r\n\r\nSoothing and inspiring music, which are relative to the topic\/issue being discussed, are also played from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe program, likewise, aims to establish a healthy interaction with its listeners that is why it encourages them to send text messages and\/or post their comments and reactions about the program in the different social networking sites. But since the program also wants to be of help to its listeners who are beleaguered by some problems, and they need some enlightenment and spiritual advice, they are encouraged to write about it and send it to the program\u2019s host. The would-be chosen letter will receive a prize of P10,000.\r\n\r\nThe last hour of DEAR KUYA (11am to 12:00nn) is devoted to the chosen letter-sender whose story will be dramatized live by UNTV-Radio La Verdad\u2019s voice talents, with Kuya Daniel as the narrator. At the end, Bro. Eli will, once again, give insights and pieces of advice which are all Bible-based.\r\n\r\nYou may send your questions, greetings, stories, and signal feedbacks thru:\r\n\r\nTWITTER: @DearKuya\r\nEMAIL: dearkuya@untvradio.com\r\nADDRESS: 907 EDSA, Brgy.

Learn their motivations and expectations as we journey towards the establishment of a peaceful Philippines.\r\n\r\nBayani ni Juan - Know what our soldiers are doing all over the country and in all levels in the performance of the AFP\u2019s IPSP Bayanihan, learn how they collaborate with the communities they\u2019re working and know their focus towards their jobs.\r\n\r\nPuno\u2019t Dulo - This segment would be showing the AFP\u2019s top level\u2019s guidance to its men and partners on how to effectively deal with the advocacy to win the peace without violating the laws and traditions being observed. It also essays the effect of the peace efforts to the communities.\r\n\r\nEpektos Atbp - This segment tackles the tangible effects of IPSP Bayanihan and other developments arising from its implementation. Expect to view interviews with rebels who surrendered due to IPSP Bayanihan, the increasing demand for all combatants to finally have peace in our country, the glee and satisfaction of partner groups upon achievement of their purpose, the noted growth of a community that had decided to reject violence and war, or AFP citing its partner\u2019s efforts.",
