                "description": "Dr. Hilarion M. Henares, Jr., Doctor of Economics, will probably be known as the Alexander Hamilton of the Philippines. As Hamilton argued for his \"Theory of Manufactures\" to point the way to the United States' emergence as an industrial power against Thomas Jefferson's advocacy of a `pastoral economy,' so did Henares argue for Philippine Industrialization against American policy to keep the Philippines agricultural.\r\n\r\nMore than anyone else, Henares is the most eloquent spokesman for the Philippine industrial middle class and he articulated for his generation the Nationalist Economic Philosophy for the advancement of the common masses. Said Education Secretary Juan Manuel, \"Fiercely nationalistic, Henares chose as his field of battle, the area of economics. There are many milestones that mark our way to economic emancipation and Henares was there first. He was a visionary, a gadfly, an achiever - who prodded this country almost against its will to accept the challenge of change in the postwar years.''\r\n\r\nHilarion M. Henares Jr., known as Larry Henares, is a graduate of Ateneo de Manila, University of the Philippines, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, an Eisenhower Fellow, an engineer, economist, educator, big businessman, writer, author of 35 books, civic leader, public servant, and hobbyist (guns, books, amateur radio and electronics).\r\n\r\nAt the age of 30, he was already the head of a multi-million peso business enterprise, manufacturing paints, chemicals, and such products as Mongol pencils, Crayola and Parker Quink. He was a businessman who was awarded Young Businessman of the Year 1959, and the Industrialist of the Year 1963 by the Business Writers Association. He was an educator and dean of two graduate schools before the age of 25. He is a film maker who won the Famas Academy Award for the Best Documentary of the Year 1957. He is a writer known for his essays on economics, history, art and culture, the most widely read front page columnist (\u201cWays and Means\u201d) in the pre-martial law Manila Times and \"Make my Day\" in the Philippine Daily Inquirer after the EDSA revolt. He is one of the first five-sided multimedia journalist, having been on radio (DZRJ-fm and DWBR-fm), on television (Channel 9, 13 and UNTV) and in the Internet http:\/\/www.philippinefolio.com, as well as on newsprint and published books.\r\n\r\nHe became the President of the powerful Philippine Chamber of Industries and a member of the Presidential Cabinet as the Chairman of the National Economic Council. \"One of the most brilliant of my cabinet,'' said President Diosdado Macapagal of him, the fifth President of the Philippine Republic. He is now a Presidential Consultant on National Affairs to the President of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nCarlos P. Romulo once said that Henares did not spend his life climbing to the peak of one career. He jumped from peak to peak in many different fields. Indeed, Henares is a modern Renaissance Man whose breadth of knowledge, experience and culture can only be surmised with the reading of his essays and listening to his speeches, already well-known for their literacy, perspicacity, wit, humor, Filipinism and deep sense of humanity. Above all, he is a Nationalist in the great tradition of Claro M. Recto and Jose Rizal, an indefatigable champion of the nationalist cause, whose life and works will show the way and the light for future generations of Filipinos.",

                "title": "Bro. Eli Soriano",
                "description": "<a>Eliseo Fernando Soriano<\/a> was born on April 4, 1947 to Triunfo Soriano and Catalina Fernando in Pasay City, Metro Manila. He is the seventh of eight siblings.\r\n\r\nDuring his childhood, Eli was very shy and reluctant to be in front of a crowd. For this reason he entered elementary school a year late and would always escape his teachers during class.\u00a0Notwithstanding his shyness, young Eli was very intelligent. His parents were able to persuade him later on to take his studies seriously and became the consistent top honor of his primary school.\r\n\r\nIn high school, Eli was elected President of the Student Council. He often\u00a0took the role of a substitute teacher in his class and in higher year level and\u00a0was even assigned as assistant to the school principal.\r\n\r\nA few days before his 17th birthday, Eli\u2019s parents brought him to a worship service in the Locale of Pasay. He was moved to tears when he heard the preaching of Bro. Nicolas Perez, the assigned worker at that time, regarding the true Church of God in the Bible. After hearing the sermon, he became interested in the Bible and began investigating. Three months before his high school graduation though, he decided to stop attending his classes to dedicate his full time in reading the Holy Scriptures. This is the reason why he wasn\u2019t able to finish high school.\r\n\r\nSoon, Eli pleaded Bro. Perez to baptize him (as the latter deemed him too young) in the Church of God where his parents and siblings are attending. On April 7, 1964, at the age of 17, he was baptized in Sineguelasan, Bacoor, Cavite at 5:05 p.m.\r\n\r\nIn his desire to zealously serve God, Bro. Eli Soriano attended the workers\u2019 ministerial classes under the instruction of Bro. Perez. With the help and mercy of God, he later became a minister of Christ and dedicated his life in serving God and the Church and in propagating the righteousness and the kingdom of God.\r\n\r\nBro. Eli conducted his first Bible study in Guagua, Pampanga. The nightly meetings bore 33 new brethren, thus establishing the Locale of Sto. Cristo, the first locale in Pampanga.\u00a0The province of Pampanga then became the first Division in the Church, which Bro. Eli himself supervised.\r\n\r\nIn debates, Bro. Eli was at the forefront to prove the faith and teachings of Christ against different pastors, ministers and priests. He was also Bro. Perez\u2019 assistant in making outline of topics being taught during the ministerial class of the church workers.\r\n\r\nIn 1975, Bro. Perez died without laying his hands onto a successor to preside over the Church. In the coming months, Brother Eli continued to outline the topics being taught to the brethren in order to keep their hopes alive.\u00a0On July 11 of the same year, members of the Board of Trustees of the church, including Bro. Eli, signed an agreement that Levita Gugulan, General Secretary of the organization, shall, as the law states, succeed Bro. Perez as \u201ctemporary\u201dpresiding officer.\r\n\r\nHowbeit, Gugulan desired to preside over the Church permanently, which is against the doctrine of the Holy Scriptures that women are not allowed to rule over the people of God.\u00a0In their belief that the group now led by Gugulan has went astray, Bro. Eli, together with the elders in the Church, left the group.\r\n\r\nOn March 30, 1977, Bro. Eli registered the group \u201cMga Kaanib sa Iglesia ng Dios kay Kristo Hesus Haligi at Saligan ng Katotohanan sa Bansang Pilipinas\u201d (Members of the Church of God in Christ Jesus, the Pillar and Ground of Truth in the Philippines, Inc.). Bro. Eli used the word \u201csaligan\u201d (ground) in reference to the Greek word hedraioma, and not \u201csuhay\u201d (brace), which is used in the group of Gugulan.\r\n\r\nThe year 1980 marked Bro. Eli Soriano\u2019s launching of his own radio program <a>Ang Dating Daan<\/a> (The Old Path). Ang Dating Daan was first aired on DWWA 1206 kHz, then in DWAR, DZME, DZMB, DWAD, DZRD, DWAN, DZXQ and in other local stations in the country.\r\n\r\nBro. Eli Soriano was also invited as guest panelist in the DZBB program, \u201cDis is Manolo and his GENIUS Family\u201d (GENIUS stands for God Eternal News In Universal Salvation). Other panelists included Bert Valinton and Domingo Filomeno of Seventh Day Adventist Church, Manuel Manzanilla of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, Agustin Tabu\u00f1ar of Iglesia Spiritista, Onnie Santiago of Iglesia ng Dios Espiritu Santo, Jess Patricio of Roman Catholic Church, Tydee Toloui of Bahai Faith, Miguel Inciong of Iglesia ng Espiritu Santo, Severino Taril, a Dr. Jose Rizal follower, Romulo Aldana, Mr. Khempis, Resty Policarpio, Aldon Tagumpay, and Rudy Natividad. For three consecutive years, Bro. Eli Soriano received the \u201cMost Outstanding Minister\u201d award in the GENIUS Family. No other minister was awarded the same after him.\r\n\r\nAng Dating Daan television counterpart was launched in 1983 on IBC 13.\u00a0In 1997, RJTV 29 accommodated the TV program when it moved out from its former station, then on SBN 21 in the year 2000. During this period, the TV program was also heard simultaneously on RMN, DZRH and 100 Radyo Natin radio stations.\r\n\r\nIt was in 2004 when Ang Dating Daan moved to UNTV 37 along the other programs of Bro. Eli, including Itanong Mo Kay Soriano (Ask Bro. Eli), Bible Guide, Truth in Focus and Biblically Speaking.\r\n\r\nOn January 13, 2004, Bro. Eli registered the current name, Members Church of God International, in response to the growing number of members in other countries, both Filipinos and non-Filipinos. Despite the persecution of other religious groups, the congregation he leads remains steadfast.\r\n\r\nBro. Eli also authored the book \u201cLeaving behind the Fundamental Doctrines of Christ,\u201d released in the late 1990\u2019s. He had also published articles in magazines such as The Blog magazine, The Old Path Magazine, Believer News magazine and Ang Dating Daan Magazine.\r\n\r\nBro. Eli Soriano also built orphanages in some parts of the country and funded their operations to accommodate orphans and helpless citizens of the country. The orphanages welcome both members and non-members of the congregation.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Bro. Eli was forced to leave the country due to the grave persecution of his opponents in other religious organizations and from several government officials. Beyond his and his enemies\u2019 expectations, leaving the Philippines gave him the opportunity to extend the mission of salvation in other countries, thus making his endeavor worldwide.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Bro. Eli Soriano began writing his own blog in e<a>soriano.wordpress.com<\/a>, which won the Most Popular Website award in the 2009 Philippine Web Awards. Another award was bestowed to Bro. Eli during the Open Web Awards from Pete Cashmore-founded Mashable.com, hailing the phenomenal preacher as the year's \"Most Educational to Follow.\"\r\n\r\nFor over three years of hosting worldwide Bible expositions in different parts of the globe, natives of different countries were able to listen to Bro. Eli\u2019s preaching and were converted to the <a>Members Church of God International<\/a>. In such a short span of time, major international coordinating centers were established in Ghana, Africa, Papua New Guinea, and South America. Members here are natives of these countries.\r\n\r\nMost recent developments have seen the Ang Dating Daan or The Old Path program viewed and heard in several parts of Asia, Africa, Europe, South America, North America and Australia through television and Cable channels, radio stations and the Internet. Literature containing Bible-based articles and collections of preachings of Bro. Eli Soriano are also being distributed for free. In the web today, Bro. Eli is also hosting a live stream program at <a>Livestream.com<\/a> and maintaining a <a>Twitter account<\/a>.",
